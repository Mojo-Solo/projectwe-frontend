# This file is created to examine the solution.tsx content and apply fix

Based on the "Unexpected token Section" error at line 93, the most common causes are:

1. Missing closing bracket (>) on JSX Section tag
2. Unmatched quotes in className attribute
3. Malformed JSX props syntax
4. React fragment syntax issues

The fix will likely be one of these patterns:

Pattern 1 - Missing closing bracket:
<Section className="py-16 bg-gray-50"    <- Missing >
Fix: <Section className="py-16 bg-gray-50">

Pattern 2 - Trailing comma:
<Section className="py-16 bg-gray-50",   <- Extra comma
Fix: <Section className="py-16 bg-gray-50">

Pattern 3 - Unmatched quotes:
<Section className="py-16 bg-gray-50     <- Missing closing quote
Fix: <Section className="py-16 bg-gray-50">

Pattern 4 - Incomplete props object:
<Section className={styles.solution      <- Missing closing brace
Fix: <Section className={styles.solution}>

Let me examine the actual file to identify the specific issue.
