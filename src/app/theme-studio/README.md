# Theme Studio - Visual Brand Customization

## What This Feature Does

The Theme Studio transforms the CSS test page into a powerful business feature that allows exit planning firms to:

1. **Match Their Brand Identity** - Customize platform colors to match corporate brand guidelines
2. **Create Industry-Specific Experiences** - Use preset themes designed for different industries
3. **White-Label the Platform** - Perfect for partnerships with law firms, accounting firms, etc.
4. **Build Client Trust** - Present in familiar colors that resonate with specific industries

## Why This Matters for Exit Planning

In exit planning, you're dealing with business owners' life work. The ability to present the platform in familiar, industry-appropriate colors creates:
